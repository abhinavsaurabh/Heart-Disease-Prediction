# Heart Disease Prediction

A predictive analytics project aimed at identifying the likelihood of heart disease based on patient data using machine learning techniques. This repository includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation steps to deliver an effective and efficient predictive model.

## 🚀 Project Objective

The primary goal of this project is to:
- Develop a robust machine learning model to predict heart disease.
- Provide insights from patient health metrics to guide healthcare decisions.
- Enable the integration of predictive models into healthcare systems for real-time risk assessment.

## 🏗️ Key Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Comprehensive cleaning, handling missing values, and normalizing data.
- **Feature Engineering:** Analysis and selection of the most influential factors in predicting heart disease.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Implementation of multiple ML algorithms including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines (SVM).
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Performance comparison using accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC score.
- **Interactive Visualizations:** Tools to understand and explain predictions.
